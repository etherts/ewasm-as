# ewasm-as
Ethereum-flavored WebAssembly AssemblyScript API

## Writing smart contracts using AssemblyScript

This library facilitates the development of [Ewasm-compatible](https://github.com/ewasm/design) smart contracts using [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript).

Install using `npm install --save-dev etherts/ewasm-as` in a clean project directory. Then initialize a new project using `npx ewasminit .`. See the [AssemblyScript getting started docs](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript#getting-started) for full documentation, as `ewasminit` wraps AssemblyScript's `asinit` command.

## Contributing

The etherts project is maintained by the [Ewasm](https://github.com/ewasm) team. Please see [Ewasm testnet contributing](https://github.com/ewasm/testnet#contributing) for information on joining or contributing to the project.
